# CSS

Cascading Style Sheets is a domain-specific, declarative, styling language which is used for setting the presentation of content and elements within an [HTML](https://github.com/iamdcj/html) document.

It provides engineers with the ability to determine how content will be rendered on a particular type of media, e.g. screen, paper.

The stylesheets inform the browser how the UI should be painted, based on the colors, positioning, features, typography, and spacing declared in the style rules.

The following sections focus on the main aspects of the language:

- [Syntax](syntax) - the code which goes into a stylesheet.
- [Core](core) - a breakdown of the core features/aspects of the language.
- [Layout](layout) - grids, flex, floats, and contexts.
- [Media Queries](media-queries) - switching things up.
- [Animations](animations) - fancy pants.
