DECLARATION
A CSS declaration is a combination of a property and a value - a colon-separated key/value pairing.

These declarations are used to style the elements within a webpage.

// PROPERTY
A property is an American-English, human-readable identifier which describes the style feature you are applying/modifying.

// VALUE
A value defines how you want to change the style, i.e. how you want the property to change.

The following declaration states that we want the color property to changed to the stated value of blue:
color: blue;

—

DECLARATION BLOCK
A declaration block, ‘a block of declarations' consists of multiple declarations contained with {parentheses},
and each declaration is terminated using a semicolon.

The following declaration blocks contains three declarations, all terminated with a semicolon:
p {
color: red;
font-size: 16px;
Font-family: serif;
}

NOTES

- The final declaration in a block does not need to be terminated.
- Declaration blocks can be empty; no declarations within the containing parentheses.
