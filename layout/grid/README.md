# CSS Grid

The grid layout module is a two-dimensional layout system specifically designed to solve common layout problems often seen in web user-interfaces.

It can handle two-dimensional layouts, that is, both rows _and_ columns can be manipulated when developing grid-based layouts. This differs to the `flex` layout system, which only handles one-direction layouts; columns _or_ rows.
