# Inline Styles

Inline styles are declarations which are applied directly to elements using the ’style’ attribute;

`<div style=“color: red”>Hola Mundial</div>`

### Why use them?

They are often used when javascript applies dynamic styles based on a user interaction/via a third-party library.

They do trump all other styles, and are often used for this purpose - see [specificity](../../specificity).
