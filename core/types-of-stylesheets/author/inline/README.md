# Inline Styles

Inline styles are declarations which are applied directly to elements using the ’style’ attribute;

`<div style=“color: red”>Hola Mundial</div>`

They are often used when JavaScript applies dynamic styles based on a user interaction, or via a third-party library loaded into the application.

**Inline styles do trump all other styles**, and are often used for this purpose - see [specificity](../../specificity).
