# Stylesheet Varieties

There are a number of different stylesheets that can be loaded into a webpage, thus becoming part of the cascade - some stylesheets are automatically added by the browser, others are added by the engineer, or the end-user;

- [**User-Agent Stylesheets**](user-agent) (M) - the browser provided stylesheets.
- [**Internal Stylesheets**](internal) (H) - developer generated stylesheets written in the `<head />` of the document.
- [**External Stylesheets**](external) (H) - developer generated stylesheets written in a separate file, loaded into the `html` document.
- [**Inline Styles**](inline) (M) - developer generated styles, directly added to an element via the `style` attribute.

##### Key

- **(M)** - Added by a machine
- **(H)** - Added by a human
